# TcpJsonClient
C# program to test sending json to a TCP client

This was orginally written to prototype the logic for sending JSON, via TCP, to a specific IP:Port.  
Pieces of this were then brought into our framework code to perform that functionality.  
Note that the listen feature is incomplete and does not work.
